# FIA-Project - Project for the class Foundations of Artificial Intelligence
Various classification algorithms are implemented to predict whether a person is prone to or is suffering from heart disease.

This repository contains all code (and outpus) and and article about this project.

We use the following 6 models:

  - Logistic Regression
  - SVM
  - NB
  - DT
  - KNN
  - Neural Networks
Hyper parameting tunning to get the parameters that give us the best accuracy on our test set (using 80:20 split ratio).
